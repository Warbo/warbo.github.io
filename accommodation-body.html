<h2>Accommodation</h2>

<p>
  There is no accommodation on site at Shustoke Barns however there are
  plenty of options nearby!
</p>
<p>
  You can use <a href="https://www.booking.com">Booking.com</a> to book your
  accommodation, or the venue has some that they
  <a href="https://crippsandco.com/shustoke-barn/accommodation">
    recommend on their website.

<p>
  Although we do hope that December is far enough into the future that our
  wedding will not be delayed due to Covid-19, many hotels/B&amp;Bs have free
  cancellation policies which you can take advantage of just in case.
