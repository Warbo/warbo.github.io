Hey,

Here are some example wedding websites:
https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/inspiration/wedding-websites-examples
Don't know if you'd rather build one from a template? There seems to be
loads out there e.g https://withjoy.com/wedding-website/

*Overall*:

   - I like Calibri as a font (or equivalent) I don't like Arial.
   - Need to incorporate our wedding colours

See image.png

I think we probably need:

- Homepage: Image of us/the wreath Hannah made

"Chris & Jo are getting married!

Saturday 11th December
Shustoke Barns, Coleshill, Birmingham"

Button to RSVP

- Tabs

*About us (or is this too cringe? Most wedding websites have one)*
*RSVP*
*On the Day schedule (more coming)*
*Details (or split accommodation/how to get here)*

- Something at the top about Covid situation - hoping that everyone can
come but situation is ever changing blah blah
- Location/how to get there
- Nearby accommodation - https://crippsandco.com/shustoke-barn/accommodation +

Comment that therre's no accommodation on site (lots nearby)
Book a taxi day before/early in the day.

*Gifts*

Some shit about how their attendance is enough but should you wish to -
we'd love a contribution towards a honeymoon.

*Need an email invite too*

Hannah's wreath
Something about due to the Covid situation and things ever changing we've
decided to create a website so should things change we can easily update you
