<h2>Gifts</h2>

<p>
  Your presence at our wedding is enough of a gift (we've not seen some of
  you for the longest time!) but should you wish to buy us something we'd
  greatly appreciate a contribution towards our dream honeymoon. We're
  looking forward to jetting off somewhere picturesque sometime in 2022.
  Galapagos Islands and New Zealand are on the shortlist...!
