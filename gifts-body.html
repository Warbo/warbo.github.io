<h2>Gifts</h2>

<p>Particularly in light of how difficult the last couple of years have been for
us all due to Covid, being able to spend our wedding day with all of our dearest
friends and families is the greatest gift we could ask for. We've not seen some
of you for the longest time!</p>

<p>We have still been asked by some of our guests what we'd like however... Over
the years we;ve amassed enough "stuff" during our nearly 14 years together
(mainly Lego, old hard-drives, 500 types of cables...) so should you wish to
provide a gift - a contribution towards our honeymoon fund would be much
appreciated! We're looking forward to jetting off somewhere picturesque as soon
as we can.</p>
